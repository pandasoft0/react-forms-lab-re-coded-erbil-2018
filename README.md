# React Controlled Components

## Objectives

1. Explain how React uses `value` on, e.g., `<input>`
2. Describe strategies for using controlled components
3. Explain how we can use controlled inputs to validating text
4. Explain the difference between `value` and `defaultValue` in a React
   controlled component
5. Practice writing and using controlled components

## Overview

This lab should give students a ton of practice validating inputs, submitting
forms, dealing with textareas, etc.

The lab will probably be pretty simple, but that's all the more reason to
really emphasize the practice that students can get from it.
